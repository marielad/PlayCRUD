# ~~~~~
# Once JDBC datasource is set up, you can work with several different
# database options:
#
# Slick (Scala preferred option): https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/PlaySlick
# JPA (Java preferred option): https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaJPA
# EBean: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaEbean
# Anorm: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAnorm
#
jpa.default = defaultPersistenceUnit
db {
  # You can declare as many datasources as you want.
  # By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

  default {
    driver = org.postgresql.Driver
    url = "jdbc:postgresql://192.168.89.50:5432/test"
    username = tester
    password = tester
    jndiName = DefaultDS

    # You can turn on SQL logging for any datasource
    # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Highlights25#Logging-SQL-statements
    #logSql=true
  }
